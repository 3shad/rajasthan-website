          <ul>
            <li>

        </li>
        <h3>
          Medieval Period
        </h3>
       <li>
        Rajput Kingdoms:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Rajputs rose to prominence around the 6th century. They established several powerful kingdoms in Rajasthan, including Mewar, Marwar, and Amber. Notable Rajput rulers include Rana Kumbha and Maharana Pratap of Mewar, who fought against the Mughal emperor Akbar
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Period:
          <ul>
            <li>Rajasthan was frequently invaded by the Delhi Sultanate. However, the Rajput kingdoms often retained a degree of autonomy. The Mughal period saw alliances between Rajputs and Mughals, with Rajput princesses marrying Mughal emperors.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <h3>
          Modern Period
        </h3>
        <li>
          Maratha Influence:
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the 18th century, the Maratha Empire expanded into Rajasthan, demanding tribute from the Rajput states. This weakened the Rajput kingdoms and made them more susceptible to British colonization.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          British Colonial Period:
          <ul>
            <li>
              By the early 19th century, most Rajput states had become princely states under British suzerainty, forming part of the Rajputana Agency.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Post-Independence:
          <ul>
            <li>
              After India gained independence in 1947, the princely states of Rajputana were integrated into the Union of India. Rajasthan was formed in 1949, combining 22 princely states and the British-administered province of Ajmer-Merwara.
